<p>In nature, <q class="good">Good</q> &amp; Evil do not exist. The Universe itself is neither <q class="good">good</q>nor <q class="bad">bad</q>, but a potential in permanent development.</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
In life, there are 4 types of people :<br>
<li class="good-image"> people who think the Internet is <q class="good">good</q>,</li>
<li class="bad-image"> people who think the Internet is evil,</li>
<li class="cat-image"> people who think the Internet is cats,</li>
<li> people who don't think about it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that 
rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing 
cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s 
no such thing as an issue.
</p>
<p>Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing 
exists if the brain doesn’t think it. Nothing exists neither if our 
senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our 
reality changes. That’s possible because our perception is limited : you
 can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis translate the message, 
our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes 
depending on that way. Therefore, if we can change reality that much, 
everything’s fake.</p>

<p>They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that
 person as divine. Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls 
from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But 
the person is the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works 
like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you 
passively do it anyway.</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer
 whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to
 commiserate. They said, <q class="quote--villagers">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</q> The farmer said, <q class="quote--farmer">“Is it<q class="good"> good</q>? Is it <q class="bad">bad</q>? I don't know.”</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="quote--villagers">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</q> The farmer again said, <q class="quote--farmer">“Is it<q class="good"> good</q>? Is it <q class="bad">bad</q>? I don't know.”</q></p> 

<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
 riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="quote--villagers">“Oh dear, that’s too <q class="bad">bad</q>,”</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="quote--villagers">“Is it <q class="good">good</q>? Is it <q class="bad">bad</q>? I don't know.”</q>
 The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people 
into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. 
Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="quote--villagers">“Isn’t that great!”</q> Again, he said, <q class="quote--farmer">“Is it <q class="good">good</q>? Is it <q class="bad">bad</q>? I don't know.”</q></p>

<p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense 
complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that 
happens in it is <q class="good">good</q> or <q class="bad">bad</q> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <q class="good">good</q> fortune.</p>

<p> </p><h2>Conclusion</h2>  
<q class="good">Good</q> and <q class="bad">Bad</q> are just one perspective. Bananas are <q class="good">good</q> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <q class="good">good</q>for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...<p></p>
